/**
 * @fileoverview Comprehensive type definitions for Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS (LZA) module system.
 *
 * @description
 * This module provides the complete type system for the LZA module execution framework,
 * defining all interfaces, types, and enumerations used throughout the module orchestration
 * and execution pipeline. These types ensure type safety and provide clear contracts
 * between different components of the LZA system.
 *
 * The type system covers:
 * - Module definitions and execution phases
 * - Configuration aggregation and management
 * - Runtime parameter structures and contexts
 * - Stage orchestration and execution ordering
 * - Promise-based execution coordination
 * - Environment and resource identification
 * - Logging and credential management
 *
 * These types are used extensively throughout the LZA codebase to ensure
 * consistent interfaces, proper error handling, and maintainable code
 * architecture across the entire deployment pipeline.

 * Provides account and region context for resource operations including

 * the LZA for cross-account and cross-region operations.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const logArchiveEnv: AcceleratorEnvironmentDetailsType = {
 *   accountId: '123456789012',
 *   accountName: 'LogArchive',
 *   region: 'us-east-1'
 * };
 *
 * // Use for resource naming
 * const bucketName = `aws-accelerator-logs-${logArchiveEnv.accountId}-${logArchiveEnv.region}`;
 *
 * // Use for cross-account operations
 * const roleArn = `arn:aws:iam::${logArchiveEnv.accountId}:role/AcceleratorRole`;
 * ```
